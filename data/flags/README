Some of these flags have been obtained using sodipodi to convert the sodipodi flags 
collection from svg to png and then modified a bit (sorry) to be of similar sizes.
Sodipodi flags collection can be found at

Those flags are licensed under the Creative Commons Public Domain license.

The rest have been obtained from www.wikipedia.org
